Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most famous well-known blockchain platforms, and **both are categorized as public blockchains**. However, they differ significantly in their fundamental purpose, supply, technical architecture, and functionality.

The primary differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are outlined below:

### Core Identity and Purpose

| Feature | Bitcoin | Ethereum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Major Usage/Purpose** | Bitcoin is a **currency**. Its major usage is a **Public payment system**. | Ethereum is a **computing platform**. Its major usage is a **Generic blockchain platform**. |
| **Scope** | Focuses specifically on the **cryptocurrency**. | Opened the possibilities of the blockchain to **other application domains**, rather than sticking with the cryptocurrency alone. |
| **Platform Type** | Bitcoin is **simple**. | Ethereum is an **Open Source Blockchain platform** which allows anyone to develop and deploy Blockchain based Applications. |

### Supply and Economics

| Feature | Bitcoin | Ethereum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supply** | Bitcoin is **limited**. There will be a total of **21 million bitcoin in production**. | Ethereum **supply is unlimited**. |

### Technical Architecture and Language

| Feature | Bitcoin | Ethereum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Contract Language** | The smart contract language is **Not Turning complete**. The software is **not Turing complete**. | The platform **is Turing complete**. Its smart contract language includes **Solidity, serpent, LLL**. |
| **Smart Contracts Execution** | Smart contract execution is **Native**. | Smart contract execution relies on the **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**. |
| **Data Model** | Uses the **UTXO** (Unspent Transaction Output) data model. | Uses the **Account based** data model. |
| **Programming** | Bitcoin is described as **simple**. | Ethereum has a **rich programming language**. |
| **Consensus Protocol** | Uses **Mining, PoW (Proof of Work) ledger level**. | Uses **PoW, PoS (Proof of Stake) transaction level**. Ethereum was based on PoW, but later the consensus mechanism was **shifted to Proof of Stake**, making it more secure and **energy-efficient**. |
| **Transaction Rate** | Bitcoin processes **seven** transactions per second. | Ethereum processes **thirty** transactions per second. |

### Community and Governance

| Feature | Bitcoin | Ethereum |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Community Size** | The Bitcoin community is **larger**. | It has a **smaller community**. |
| **Governance** | Not Applicable (N/A). | Governed by **Ethereum developers**. |

In essence, Bitcoin established the blockchain as a digital payment system, prioritizing security and scarcity through its fixed supply and PoW. Ethereum took the foundational technology and expanded it into a **decentralized computation platform** that allows developers to build complex applications using smart contracts, making it more flexible for a broader range of use cases.
